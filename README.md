# PLEASE NOTE!

This library started life as a fork of
[Paramiko](https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko) but has now been [fully merged
back upstream](http://bitprophet.org/blog/2012/09/29/paramiko-and-ssh/).

As such, 'ssh' is defunct and will receive no future releases or attention:
please change your dependencies back to Paramiko, and file any feature requests
or bugfixes over on [Paramiko's
tracker](https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/issues).

We apologize for the inconvenience of switching dependencies around; it was the
least crummy option open to us. [The
announcement](http://bitprophet.org/blog/2012/09/29/paramiko-and-ssh/)
(including comments!) explains the history and decision making in greater
detail.
